# Frontend Tech Challenge (Editor)

The challenge requires you to build a small content creation tool that can help you edit selected images and download them. 

For the challenge, you should use free image gallery API Lorem Pictus. Detail documentation of the API [`https://picsum.photos/`](https://picsum.photos/).

The application should satisfy these user stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to browse through the list of images.
    - Images list should be paginated.
    - Image item should include image preview and author's name.
- As a user, I want to click an image and be navigated to the edit image page.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit image:
    - User can select image size [height, width]
    - User can choose greyscale mode.
    - User can blur the image (grade between 1 - 10)
    - User should see the currently edited image preview
- As a user, I want to be able to download edited image
- As a user, I want to be able to refresh the page at any point and still get the previous result
- As a user I want the page to remember where I was when going back in history

**Getting started**

There are no any requirements on what stack to use to solve the task, so there is nothing set up beforehand.

**Notes**

- This is technically possible to implement only on the front end.
- Please focus more on code quality, building a robust solution and such, than on the UI.
